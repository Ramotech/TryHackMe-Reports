# TryHackMe - Defensive Security Lab: Blocking a Malicious IP

## Scenario
During this hands-on lab, I detected suspicious activity from a specific IP address using open-source reputation tools. After investigating, I confirmed the IP was malicious and followed the correct escalation process within a simulated SOC environment. I then blocked the IP on the firewall to prevent further unauthorized access attempts.

## Steps taken
1. Identified unusual authentication attempts from IP: `143.110.250.149`.
2. Verified the reputation of the IP using an online scanner, confirming it was malicious.
3. Escalated the incident to the SOC Team Lead to request authorization to block the IP.
4. Implemented the block rule on the company firewall.
5. Confirmed the threat was mitigated successfully.

## Key concepts practiced
- Security event escalation process
- Using IP reputation services
- Basic network defense and firewall administration
- Incident response workflow
