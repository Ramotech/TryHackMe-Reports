# Network Basics Lab: Using Ping & ICMP

## Scenario
In this lab, I used the `ping` command to test connectivity and latency between my system and various target IP addresses, both private and public.

## Steps Performed
1. Used `ping` to test the private IP address `192.168.1.254` and analyzed the response times and packet loss.
2. Repeated the test using the public address `8.8.8.8`, retrieving a lab-specific flag upon success.
3. Examined statistics such as round-trip time (RTT), packet transmission, and reception.

## Key Concepts Learned
- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) basics
- Using the `ping` command for network diagnostics
- Interpreting timing statistics and packet loss to assess connectivity
